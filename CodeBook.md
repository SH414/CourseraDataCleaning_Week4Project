This code book describes the variables, the data, and the work performed to clean up the data.
Download the data, and name each variable appropriately using the read.table function.
Merge the datasets using rbind and cbind.
Calcuate the mean and standard deviation (std) for each variable.
Subset the dataset to include only the means and standard deviations.
Check labelling of resulting dataset and amend such that variable names are informative.
Write tidy dataset to file, and save this in working directory.
